# XLdefgen
### A framework for the automatic generation of cross-lingual definitions.


Data should be accessed via the Hugging Face datasets library unless the desired dataset is already saved to disk.

Change the working directory to XLdefgen/model, and then run *run_translation_no_trainer.py* as indicated in the model README.

***This project is still under development.***
